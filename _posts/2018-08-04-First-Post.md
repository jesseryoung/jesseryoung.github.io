First Post
==========

So, this is the first post on this site. I figured that because I went through with setting up a blog why not make a post about it. Original idea right?

Setting up a blog
-----------------
I actually toyed around with the idea of writing my own blog "engine" to run my blog. I figured it would make a great first post: "How to build your own blog". I attempted this several times, and each time pretty much went like this:
1. Make myself a drink.
2. Download the latest versions of .Net Core and VSCode.
3. Research some Nuget packages on how to render Markdown to html.
4. Start to write some code.
5. Realize it's been 4 hours and I'm 5 drinks deep at this point. Also I need to go to work tomorrow.
6. Forget about writing a blog for 6 months.

After noticing this pattern, I figured I'd try something a little different.

Using GitHub Pages
